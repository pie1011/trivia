# KATIE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Next.js 15 trivia application bootstrapped with `create-next-app`. The project uses React 19, Bootstrap 5.3.7, and React Bootstrap for styling.

**App Concept**: Interactive trivia game using the Open Trivia Database API (https://opentdb.com/) to provide questions across multiple categories and difficulty levels.

## Development Commands

- **Start development server**: `npm run dev` (uses Turbopack for faster builds)
- **Build for production**: `npm run build`
- **Start production server**: `npm start`
- **Lint code**: `npm run lint`

## Project Structure

- **App Router**: Uses Next.js App Router with the `src/app/` directory structure
- **Styling**: Combines CSS modules (page.module.css) with Bootstrap and custom global styles
- **Fonts**: Uses Geist font family via `next/font/google`
- **Path aliases**: `@/*` maps to `./src/*` (configured in jsconfig.json)

## Key Files

- `src/app/layout.js`: Root layout with global font configuration and Bootstrap CSS import
- `src/app/page.js`: Main homepage component
- `src/app/globals.css`: Global CSS with dark mode support
- `eslint.config.mjs`: ESLint configuration extending Next.js core web vitals

## Architecture Notes

- Uses Next.js App Router (not Pages Router)
- Bootstrap is imported globally in layout.js
- CSS custom properties support dark mode automatically
- Font optimization handled by Next.js font system

## Trivia App Features

### Core Functionality
- **Question Display**: Show trivia questions with multiple choice or true/false answers
- **Category Selection**: Allow users to choose from available categories (General Knowledge, Science, History, etc.)
- **Difficulty Levels**: Easy, Medium, and Hard question options
- **Score Tracking**: Real-time score calculation and display
- **Timer**: Optional countdown timer for each question
- **Results Summary**: Show final score and correct answers review

### API Integration
- **Open Trivia Database API**: https://opentdb.com/api_config.php
- **No API Key Required**: Free to use with rate limiting considerations
- **Question Formats**: Support for multiple choice and boolean (true/false) questions
- **HTML Entity Decoding**: Questions may contain HTML entities that need decoding

### Planned Components
- `QuestionCard`: Display individual trivia questions
- `CategorySelector`: Choose trivia categories
- `ScoreBoard`: Track and display current score
- `GameSettings`: Configure difficulty, number of questions, timer settings
- `ResultsScreen`: Show final results and answer review
- `LoadingSpinner`: Show while fetching questions from API

### Data Flow
1. User selects game settings (category, difficulty, number of questions)
2. Fetch questions from Open Trivia Database API
3. Display questions one by one with answer options
4. Track user responses and calculate score
5. Show final results with option to play again

### API Endpoints
- **Base URL**: `https://opentdb.com/api.php`
- **Categories**: `https://opentdb.com/api_category.php`
- **Example**: `https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=10&category=9&difficulty=easy&type=multiple`

### State Management
- Use React hooks (useState, useEffect) for local state
- Consider Context API for global game state if complexity grows
- Store game settings, current question, score, and progress

### Styling Approach
- Leverage Bootstrap components for rapid UI development
- Use React Bootstrap for interactive components
- Custom CSS modules for component-specific styling
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop play

### Error Handling
- Handle API failures gracefully
- Provide fallback content when API is unavailable
- Show user-friendly error messages
- Implement retry mechanisms for failed requests

### Performance Considerations
- Preload next question while user answers current one
- Implement proper loading states
- Consider caching categories and recent questions
- Optimize re-renders with React.memo and useCallback where needed
